# MyDoorDash
This is my own food delivery app using DD api. :)

This is the init version of a mini DoorDash app.

Libaries that I used:
* OKHttp for network calls
* Gson for convertion between string and json
* Picasso for image caching 

Code Structure:
* Activities
* Fragments
* Models
* Adapters

Patterns:
* Viewholder Pattern for optimizing scrolling

Caveats:
* UI is not that beautiful due to time constraints, will refactor later
* Network API wrapper is not available yet due to time constraints
* RxJava/Android is not available yet due to time constraints
